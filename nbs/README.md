# Jupyter Notebooks

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks for this work. Some notebooks are
used for generating the figures that were included in the manuscript (numbered
notebooks). The other notebooks serve as supplementary resources for various
tasks.

You can download the data from the Zenodo repository:
[https://zenodo.org/records/10066227](https://zenodo.org/records/10066227).

If you want to reproduce the entire work, you need to run the MATLAB files. Each
MATLAB code for simulation exports one file with the resident strategies over
the time steps of the evolutionary process.

The files need to be "cleaned" before reading them into the notebooks. To do
this, you need to use the script `scripts/clean_data`.
